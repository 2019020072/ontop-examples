- cost-estimator-krishnamurty.py: Python script that estimates the costs according to our cost model. Such script behaves like our cost-model in the Wisconsin scenario, but it is not a full implementation of our cost-model. Do not attempt to use it as a general cost-model.

- calibration-constants.txt: Calibration constants for the various databases. Replace the definitions accordingly in file cost-estimator-krishnamurty.py. However, keep in mind that such constants were found by calibrating *our* installation, so they will be most probably meaningless on other installations. You should recalibrate them in order to have an accurate prediction for your installation.
