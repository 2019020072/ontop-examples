This folder contains the needed material in order to replicate the CTE-based tuning experiments for the Wisconsin setting described in the paper for [VLDB 2015](vldb-2015).

The folder is organized as follows:

- **wisconsinDB2:** Material to replicate the experiments in DB2;
- **wisconsinPostgres:** Material to replicate the experiments in PostgreSQL;
- **wisconsinDataGenerator:** A small java program to create a csv file (of tunable size) for pumping the wisconsin table.
