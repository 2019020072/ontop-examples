Choice of the URI templates
===========================

Until now, we have been using the local identifiers from the data sources
to build 3 different URI templates for the persons of these two universities.

TODO: continue


### Manual approach

TODO: prepare partial files for the manual part

### Canonical URIs

Download the following files: [university-canonical.ttl](https://github.com/ontop/ontop-examples/raw/master/ekaw-tutorial-2016/session2/university-canonical.ttl)
and [university-canonical.obda](https://github.com/ontop/ontop-examples/raw/master/ekaw-tutorial-2016/session2/university-canonical.obda) files.



Look at the 3 last mapping assertions.
